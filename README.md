<b>Synopsis:</b><br>
Namaste World! In the following few directories you will find demo Hbase Java codes written to work with Hbase server.<br>
The codes have been distributed in maven subprojects/ sub modules along with unit test results on Hbase shell, to have a better explanation 
of how things work

<b>Motivation:</b><br>
Hbase shell commands are limited after a certain point to work on Htables, Java code expands this to greater realm,
If understood correctly, playing with Hbase will never be as easier.
